                Age: 28 yrs<br>
                Class: Gloom Stalker ranger<br>
                Story: Abandoned by his unknown parents and raised by the harsh lessons of the streets of Vladrich,
                he grew to be a cunning master of the city's urban districts. Surviving by his experience and
                quick hands, he learned one thing: no one was on his side.
                That was until he met Alexandria, a high-elf he found begging in the streets of Elara's Capitol.
                She was the first step to him learning that there is more to life than surviving it. </p></div>

                Age: 32 yrs<br>
                Class: Way of Mercy Monk<br>
                Story: A high elf found in low places, Alexandria found herself struggling to survive after her parents
                were killed because of a feud she did not know existed. After years of travel and struggle, she found
                herself in Elara's Capitol, wishing her parents had coddled her less and taught her how to survive.
                As she stopped for the night and tried to rest, a few members of an Elarian patrol found themselves
                bored and began to harass and beat her. Thankfully, Alestur was nearby and had plenty of untreated
                trauma to take out on them. </p></div>

                <div class="text-content"><h2>Grogth</h2><p>Species: Half-Orc<br>
                Age: 42 yrs<br>
                Class: Path of the Ancestral Guardian Barbarian<br>
                Story: Grogth spent the last decade wandering Elara and Wustoria, trying to find a way to honor his ancestors.
                His mother had fallen in love with a human, a union his clan could not tolerate. He grew up an outcast among his
                kin, all of whom were famous for their conquests, performed to please their ancestors and pass on tradition.
                One day, he saw a dispute break out between residents and the guards of an Elarian outpost. The conflict ended as
                all do when a militant force is involved: in blood, tears, and corpses. Grogth noticed two children trapped between
                bodies and blades and rushed to protect them. Suddenly, an arrow flew from nowhere and struck a guard about to attack
                Grogth from behind. Landing squarely in the only uncovered part of his neck, the guard fell. Then, as if materializing,
                two elves leapt in: Alestur and Alexandria. Alexandria grabbed the children and took them to cover while Alestur
                finished off the remaining guards. They then aided whoever they could, giving supplies and healing while taking nothing
                in return. In that moment, something stirred in Grogth. He decided that by serving the meek, he would also be serving
                his ancestors. At first, Alestur refused to let Grogth join them. "Orcs are just humans with more anger and less intellect,"
                Alestur said. "Both only strive for power at the expense of anything, including their own kind." Grogth learned that Alestur
                actively hated and hunted humans and orcs, but only those he witnessed harming the weak and innocent. After Grogth explained
                his desires, Alestur gave him a chance. The orc went from a possible enemy to a brother Alestur never thought he would have.</p></div>

                Age: 16 yrs<br>
                Class: Undescovered<br>
                Story: Struggles between those with power and those without. What's new?
                
                All that mattered to me was my sister, Seriah, and I would do anything to protect her. But I couldn't do much, and no one
                ever helped. Since no one ever helped, I never thought to ask. In fact, I refused. I figured no one would help even if I
                did, and I didn't have time to find out.
                
                I will never forget that day, though.
                
                All three of them—the elf couple and the orc—didn't even know each other. Yet they threw themselves into danger without hesitation
                to protect strangers, to protect my sister and me. I had never owed anything to anyone before, but if I had to owe my life to someone,
                I'm glad it was them./</p></div>

                Age: 13 yrs<br>
                Class: Undescovered<br>
                Story: My brother always held my hand firmly, his grip a constant, protective pressure. He was always scanning our surroundings for threats;
                for the "monsters" he warned me about. I rarely knew what he meant. He’d always remind me that in this world, it was just the two of us
                against everything else, so I never strayed far from his side.
                
                One time, some aggressive men started shouting at us, closing in. In an instant, my brother pulled me behind him, whispering fiercely for me
                to stay quiet. I was terrified and squeezed my eyes shut. When I finally dared to open them, the scene had changed completely. An elf woman with
                ears like sharpened leaves stood there, beside a man with intense, piercing eyes. And with them, an orc. He was a mountain of green muscle. All
                he did was let out a low, rumbling growl, and the men who had been so threatening just seconds before scattered.
                
                The elf woman offered me a gentle smile, and the fear just melted away. But it was my brother’s reaction that I remember most. His mouth was hanging
                open, his face a mask of pure disbelief. He had drilled it into my head my whole life that no one would ever help us, that we were on our own. And yet,
                these strangers had. From that day on, we became a strange kind of family. And though we were all supposedly brothers and sisters, it was clear that
                Alestur and Alexandria had become the parents we never had.</p></div>
